# JustinsideChow - Personal Website Porfolio - [https://justinsidechow.com](https://justinsidechow.com)

## Overview

Hello world! This personal website was the culmination of my front-end developing experience and the showcase of those skills. The motivation for this project is to market my programming skills and have a central node for contacts to view my projects. The problem as a newly graduated Computer Scientist is the lack of contacts to connect and standout in the crowd. This website is meant to mediate those obsticals and connect with one another.

The **language/frameworks** used for this project were:
- Frontend
    - Typescript
    - React.js
    - HTML
    - CSS
- Backend
    - Node.js
    - AWS Lightsail

## Overview

Hello world! This personal website was the culmination of my front-end developing experience and the showcase of those skills. The motivation for this project is to market my programming skills and have a central node for contacts to view my projects. The problem as a newly graduated Computer Scientist is the lack of contacts to connect and standout in the crowd. This website is meant to mediate those obstacles and connect with one another.

The **language/frameworks** used for this project were:
- Frontend
    - Typescript
    - React.js
    - HTML
    - CSS
- Backend
    - Node.js
    - AWS Lightsail

I used Typescript and React due to its industry standard and ease of development. At first I wanted to use Javascript but chose Typescript due to its static strongly typing and interface which allows for more information in debugging. This solution would save time in future development as there are no ambiguity issues during compiling. HTML5 and CSS6 is standard for web interfaces go and that is a given as to why I used them for this project. Node.js was the perfect choice for backend hosting as AWS Lightsail have presets in Bitnami for fast development. AWS Lightsail was also the cheapest option as the website wouldn't see much traffic and would allow me to scale higher if the need arrives. 

Some of the greatest challenges in this project was the CSS scalability to work well with mobile without using a framework like bootstrap. Working everything manually was an eye-opening experience as every little margin or padding or display setting could mess with the page. I was particularly focus on having it adapt to every resolution size horizontally and most major phone size available in google developer mode. I rendered the NavBar to always be on top and the Footer to always be at the bottom. Whenever the viewer clicks on the various link and home pages, only the center section would change. The BrowserRouter would use the Switch to change the pages. Since I am not passing any data throughout the different page changes or to the backend, there wasn't much I needed to use more than Routes. In the end this project was an educational experience. 


## Pages

- **About** 
    - A simple about me page with a colorful laptop in the background while describing why I wanted to become a programmer. The first impression is always important when introducing oneself to another.
- **Github**
    - The page where I will update whenever I finish another github project so others will get a brief overview of those projects. Probably the most important page besides the about me when it comes to the core of the website descriptions.
- **Twitch**
    - The Twitch page required the react-twitch-embed to embed the Twitch stream into the website page. Without that plugin, this page would not have been possible to showcase my hobby to stream.
- **Youtube**
    - The video posted on this page describe why I wanted to start streaming in the first place. That is to maximize the value within video gameplays and capitalize of those moments.
- **Mausoleum**
    - The clothing merchandise supplements the entire package of capitalizing the streaming audience with some unique designs made from me. The mausoleum website was made from Shopify but was also designed by me.
-  **Contact**
    - Contact me if you have any questions or just want to connect!
